# 📋 Documentation Update Summary

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed English README Issues

- ❌ **Fixed broken npm badge link** (was: `httppm/v/...`, now: proper badge.fury.io link)
- ✂️ **Removed duplicate/redundant sections** that made the document confusing
- 🧹 **Cleaned up overly complex formatting** and inconsistent styling
- 📝 **Restructured content** to match the clear, concise structure of the Chinese version
- ✨ **Ensured consistency** between English and Chinese versions

### 2. Document Structure Alignment

Both README.md and README_zh.md now have:

- ✅ **Consistent header design** with proper badge links
- ✅ **Clear feature highlights** with new features marked as 🆕
- ✅ **Quick start section** with 3-step safelist example
- ✅ **Configuration table** with all options properly documented
- ✅ **Detailed feature explanations** with examples
- ✅ **Proper build tool integration examples**

### 3. New Feature Documentation

Successfully documented all three new features:

#### 📝 `collectClasses` Option

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `false`
- Description: Auto-collect generated classes
- Usage examples provided in both languages

#### 📂 `outputPath` Option

- Type: `string`
- Default: `'./safelist-classes.js'`
- Description: Output path for collected classes
- Custom path examples included

#### ⚡ `skipIfNoChanges` Option

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `true`
- Description: Skip generation if no changes
- Performance optimization highlighted

### 4. Best Practices Section

Added comprehensive safelist configuration examples:

```json
// Build tool configuration
{
  "collectClasses": true,
  "outputPath": "./config/safelist-classes.js",
  "skipIfNoChanges": true,
  "exclude": ["config/**/*", "safelist-classes.js", "tailwind.config.js"]
}
```

```ts
// TailwindCSS configuration
const { safelistClasses } = require('./safelist-classes.js')

module.exports = {
  safelist: [...safelistClasses],
  // ... rest of config
}
```

### 5. Anti-Circular Dependency Information

Both documents now clearly explain:

- 🔄 **Smart detection** prevents infinite build loops
- 🛡️ **Multiple safeguards** prevent duplicate generations
- ⚡ **Performance optimization** only regenerates when needed
- 🚫 **Proper exclusion patterns** to avoid circular dependencies
